# This file constitutes the main user entry point into Climpact.
#
# BUGS
#   - Currently SPEI/SPI are calculated via the old Climpact code. This is because the CRAN package for SPEI/SPI does not
#     ostenisbly support large runs of NA values. When this occurs real numbers are included in the output where NA values
#     should occur.
#
# TECHNICAL NOTES
#   - See server/Climpact_developer_documentation.md for a technical document describing the major parts of this code. Refer
#     to this for insight when making changes such as adding indices.
#
# HISTORY
#   The Climpact code has evolved very heavily since it's original incarnation in the form of the single source file climpact.r.
#   The significant changes that have taken place include;
#   - the calculation of the indices is almost entirely taken care of by climdex.pcic (with several exceptions such as the
#     heatwave indices and SPEI/SPI).
#   - the user interface has been re-written with R Shiny
#   - the indices can now be calculated on netCDF files.
#
#   Several people contributed significantly to the development of the original Climpact software (which was originally derived
#   from RClimdex). For posterity and credit, below is a list of the key names and dates attributed to different changes.
