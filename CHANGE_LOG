3.1.0   19 July 2021
* Fixed a bug affecting station-based calculations where GSL, SPEI and the heatwave indices (Tx90, Tn90 and EHF-PA13) assumed the station was in the northern hemisphere.
* Fixed a bug affecting the Excess Cold Factor (ECF) where the final year of data was being unnecessarily made NA for southern hemisphere locations.
* Added invisible option for gridded calculations on irregular grids (such as is used in RCM's) that allows latitude data to be retrieved from the two dimensional 
  latitude coordinate variable instead of being projected by the proj4 package.

3.0.5   11 March 2021
* Add check to skip Sens slope calculation when there is limited valid values for SPI/SPEI (this was causing "Replacement has length zero"/"IFAULT" errors).

3.0.4   09 April 2021
* Improve error exception handling and push errors to Shiny. This should reduce the frequency of "Disconnected from server" messages that aren't accompanied by R error messages.

3.0.3	10 March 2021
* Removed erroneous reference to "Runit" package, minor documentation updates.

3.0.2	22 January 2021
* Corrected a bug causing the SPI and SPEI indices to be recorded with incorrect filenames and with incorrect metadata, when calculating indices for station data (thanks D. Ogier).

3.0.1       10 January 2021
* Correct user guide install instructions and remove a problem-causing symbol from user interface (thanks J. Ding).

3.0.0		17 December 2020
* MAJOR UPDATE: Shiny interface finally released and instance deployed to https://ccrc-extremes.shinyapps.io/climpact/.
* Missing dates allowed in station input files (i.e. rows in text file can be missing). These dates will be treated as missing values.
* Both comma and tab delimiters allowed in station text files.
* Column names in station text files are allowed (and will be ignored).
* CDD/CWD changed to annual only indices.
* Station trends are now Sens slope and report the 95% confidence intervals.
* Removed *thres_spei.csv since only station values were being reported.
* QC plots now stored in a single .pdf file with titles for each plot type.
* When insufficient data exists for quantile calculations the heatwave aspects HWN and HWF now show up as NA values. Whereas before they were zero which is nonsensical. 
  This means plots are no longer created for these heatwave aspects, which is the correct behaviour. Thanks to Guido from Rome.
* Thanks to Jorge Vazquez-Aguirre, Enric Aguilar, Tosi NAKAEGAWA for various feedback.

1.2.8		3 February 2020
* Fixed 2D coordinate variables not always writing out correctly to netCDF.
* Fixed cooling degree days and heating degree day base temperature flags being properly carried through from the wrapper script to the respective functions.

1.2.7		25 April 2019
* Fixed batch script error where the parameters in the batch metadata file relating to rxnday, rnnmm and txdtnd were not being used in the index calculations.
* Fixed error where custom indices specified in the GUI that utilised mean daily temperature (TM) were not being calculated.

1.2.6       10 March 2019
* Edited the command line argument test to fix the need to manually call "startss()" when starting the GUI on Windows systems.
* Minor update of README.

1.2.5       28 February 2019
* Replaced degree symbols in climate.indices.csv with "degrees_C"
* Removed legacy "locally weighted scatterplot smoothing" line from plots generated by the GUI.

1.2.4		23 January 2019
* Empty .csv files are no longer written for indices that are not calculated.
* Missing dates in input file (i.e. missing rows) are now checked for and reported in a text file (ending in "missing_dates"). The user cannot proceed without 
  fixing missing dates, either by filling them in with data or missing values (-99.9).
* Fixed trend information being printed in .csv file for indices that aren't calculated.
* Added a 'Frequency' column to the output trend file to distinguish indices calculated on monthly and annual scales.
* Slight improvement to the writing of error files when running in batch mode.
* Fixed writing out of base period dates in SPEI/SPI thresholds file.
* Minor code clean up.
* Thanks to cicatrixx for feedback.
* This CHANGE LOG was started.
